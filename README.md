# spotify-top-hits
Predict whether a song will be included in the spotify top hits playlist or not

## introduction
### background information and project goal
The aim of our project is to use various data from popular songs to determine what factors 
contribute to a popular song and if a new song will be a top hit.
### dataset used
The dataset we will be using is a collection of the top ~1000 songs on spotify ranked by
their number of streams.

## preliminary exploratory data analysis
refer to data_anaylsis.ipynb file.

## methods 
we will conduct our data analysis using various columns in thet dataset such as tempo (bpm), 
danceability, liveliness, acousticness, etc. to create a kNN prediction model.
### method of visualization
We will use a scatterplot graph to help visualize our prediction model.

## expected outcomes and significance
We expect songs that are generally upbeat and have a fast tempo to be more popular.
The impact of our findings can give us an insight in what features music listeners today
enjoy. Our findings also represent a reflection our culture as they reveal what current 
day societal values and concerns are.
Some further questions this could lead to are how music genres evolve throughout time? 
What factors contribute to the emergence of new genres and the decline of existing ones?
