# spotify-top-hits
Analyze using various factors that constitude a song to forecast what is the song genre.

## introduction
### background information and project goal
The aim of our project is to use various data from popular songs in order to predict 
what kind of genre would a song be when knowing several factors of the song.

### dataset used
The dataset we will be using is a collection of the top ~21000 songs on spotify ranked by
their number of streams.

## preliminary exploratory data analysis
refer to data_anaylsis.ipynb file.

## methods 
we will conduct our data analysis using various columns in thet dataset such as tempo (bpm), 
danceability, liveliness, acousticness, etc. to create a kNN prediction model.

### method of visualization
We will use a barplot graph and put the factors of different genre side by side to help 
visualize our prediction model.

## expected outcomes and significance
We expect songs that are generally upbeat and have a fast tempo to be more popular.
The impact of our findings can give us an insight in what features music listeners today
enjoy. Our findings also represent a reflection our culture as they reveal what current 
day societal values and concerns are.
Some further questions this could lead to are how music genres evolve throughout time? 
What factors contribute to the emergence of new genres and the decline of existing ones?
